Enhancements for PPL 0.8
========================

- Reduce the number of FIXMEs to no more than 40.
- Improve the documentation about shared libraries.
  See http://www.cs.unipr.it/pipermail/ppl-devel/2005-July/006178.html.
- Improve the documentation of Polyhedron::shrink_bounding_box().
  See http://www.cs.unipr.it/pipermail/ppl-devel/2005-July/006191.html.
- Add our implementation of bounded difference shapes.
- Decide which interfaces should be provided for the simplex method,
  write them, and write the documentation for them.
- The Powerset class implementation is still poorly documented.
- Consider renaming Powerset::meet_assign().
- Clearly explain, in the documentation, how (not) to use
  set_GMP_memory_allocation_functions().  More generally, explain how
  to have memory-guarded computations.
- Reconsider the handling of temporary coefficients.
- In the Prolog interface, reconsider the functionality and names of the
  "with_token" predicates.
- The documentation has been read through but a more careful check,
  particularly on the detailed descriptions, should be done.

Enhancements for PPL 0.9
========================

- Incorporate the domain of rational grids.
- Provide a single, generic implementation to replace all our status
  classes.

Enhancements for PPL 0.9 or later versions
==========================================

- Implement void Polyhedron::envelope_assign(const Polyhedron& y).
- Implement the extrapolation operators defined in HenzingerH95
  and HenzingerPW01.
- See whether, using the techniques described in
  ftp://ftp.ifor.math.ethz.ch/pub/fukuda/reports/polyunion001120.ps.gz
  we can implement bool poly_hull_assign_if_exact(PH& p, const PH& q),
  temporarily in algorithms.hh, more efficiently.
- Provide optimized implementations of Polyhedron::expand_dimension()
  Polyhedron::fold_dimensions().


Constructions on Polyhedra
==========================

Since version 0.6, the PPL supports the determinate and powerset
constructions of the constraint system hierarchy described in

  R. Bagnara.
  A hierarchy of constraint systems for data-flow analysis
  of constraint logic-based languages.
  Science of Computer Programming 30, 1-2 (January 1998), pp. 119-155.
  Available at http://www.cs.unipr.it/~bagnara/Papers/Abstracts/SCP98

The implementation consists in a generic implementation (in the form
of C++ templates) of the hierarchy, plus a specialization of the
powerset construction on polyhedra.  What is missing now is the
ask-and-tell construction.  We have some old code implementing it
but it requires extensive work.


Efficiency Issues
=================

- There must be a more efficient way to implement
  bool Polyhedron::is_disjoint_from(const Polyhedron&).

- There must be a more efficient way to compute convex
  differences.

- We are being rather careless about the creation of temporaries
  as far as the classes Linear_Expression, Constraint and Generator
  are concerned.


Cutting-Plane Methods
=====================

Suppose we are only interested in integral solutions (as is the
case, e.g., in most termination analyses).  Then cutting-plane methods
(Gomory, Chvátal, ...) allow to shrink polyhedra still not losing any
integral solution.
See http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/Documentation/bibliography#NemhauserW88


Z-Polyhedra
===========

We plan to extend the PPL to deal with Z-polyhedra [Ancourt91th].
Z-polyhedra are intersections and other representations for discrete sets.

  multiprocesseurs à mémoires locales.

Grids Domain
============

-  Complete the implementation of any missing operators:
      ????covered (or bounded) widening and extrapolation operators
      is_bounded
      bounds_from_above
      bounds_from_below
      maximize
      minimize
      add_congruences for constraints
      add_recycled_congruences for constraints
      add_recycled_congruences_and_minimize for constraints
      similar operators where "congruences" is replaced by "constraints"
      upper_bound_assign_and_minimize (as for join_assign_and_minimize).

-  Check all FIX's and either remove or convert to FIXME's
   with explanatory comment.

-  Eliminate as many FIXME's as possible.

-  clean-up the gcdext addition.

-  Check the tests cover all the code.

-  Add ascii_dump/0 to all classes

-  Documentation needs checking and revising; in many places the
   cut and paste from the corresponding files for polyhedra has not
   been adapted for grids.

-  Develop a C interface.

-  Develop a Prolog interface.

-  Merge the branch with the main trunk.
