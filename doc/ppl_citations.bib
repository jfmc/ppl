  Abstract = "Despite its simplicity, the size-change termination
              principle, presented by Lee, Jones and Ben-Amram in
              [LJB01], is surprisingly strong and is able to show
              termination for a large class of programs. A significant
              limitation for its use, however, is the fact that the
              SCT requires data types to be well-founded, and that all
              mechanisms used to determine termination must involve
              decreases in these global, well-founded partial orders.
              Following is an extension of the size-change principle
              that allows for non-well founded data types, and a
              realization of this principle for integer data
              types. The extended size-change principle is realized
              through combining abstract interpretation over the
              domain of convex polyhedra with the use of size-change
              graphs. In the cases when data types \emph{are} well
              founded, the method handles every case that is handled
              by LJB size-change termination.  The method has been
              implemented in a subject language independent shared
              library, \texttt{libesct} (available at [Ave05a]), as
              well as for the ANSI C specializer
              $\texttt{C-Mix}_\texttt{II}$, handling a

              \emph{inequalities} of bounded degree is presented using

              overapproximating basic semi-algebraic sets, i.e., sets
              defined by conjunctions of polynomial inequalities, by
              means of convex polyhedra.  While improving on the
              existing methods for generating invariant polynomial
              \emph{equalities}, since polynomial inequalities are
              allowed in the guards of the transition system, the
              approach does not suffer from the prohibitive complexity
              of the methods based on quantifier-elimination.  The
              application of our implementation to benchmark programs
              shows that the method produces non-trivial invariants in
              reasonable time.  In some cases the generated invariants

  Abstract = "The explosive growth of embedded electronics is bringing
              information and control systems of increasing complexity
              to every aspects of our lives. The most challenging
              designs are safety-critical systems, such as
              transportation systems (e.g., airplanes, cars, and
              trains), industrial plants and health care
              monitoring. The difficulties reside in accommodating
              constraints both on functionality and
              implementation. The correct behavior must be guaranteed
              under diverse states of the environment and potential
              failures; implementation has to meet cost, size, and
              power consumption requirements. The design is therefore
              subject to extensive mathematical analysis and
              simulation. However, traditional models of information
              systems do not interface well to the continuous evolving
              nature of the environment in which these devices
              operate.  Thus, in practice, different mathematical
              representations have to be mixed to analyze the overall
              behavior of the system. \emph{Hybrid systems} are a
              particular class of mixed models that focus on the
              combination of discrete and continuous subsystems. There
              is a wealth of tools and languages that have been
              proposed over the years to handle hybrid
              systems. However, each tool makes different assumptions
              on the environment, resulting in somewhat different
              notions of hybrid system. This makes it difficult to
              share information among tools. Thus, the community
              cannot maximally leverage the substantial amount of work
              that has been directed to this important topic. In this
              paper, we review and compare hybrid system tools by
              highlighting their differences in terms of their
              underlying semantics, expressive power and mathematical
              mechanisms.  We conclude our review with a comparative
              summary, which suggests the need for a unifying approach
              to hybrid systems design. As a step in this direction,
              we make the case for a \emph{semantic-aware interchange
              format}, which would enable the use of joint techniques,
              make a formal comparison between different approaches
              possible, and facilitate exporting and importing design
              representations."

              temporal logic, automata or scheduling
              techniques. However, scheduling techniques are often
              pessimistic and require an almost complete knowledge of

              gives to the designer the advantages of formal methods
              and some simplicity in manipulating real-time systems
              notions. This method is able to model and validate all

              pessimism, while guaranteeing the terminaison of the
              validation process. Moreover, its formalism enables to
              study systems of which we have only a partial knowledge,
              and thus to validate or invalidate a system still under
              design. This latest point is very important, since it
              greatly decreases the cost of design backtracks."

              relationships among pointer expressions. The algorithm

              as to discover numeric constraints on the values of
              initialized elements.  The analysis is based on the

              numeric domains. We describe a prototype implementation

  Abstract = "A logic based general approach to abstract
              interpretation of low-level machine programs is
              reported. It is based on modelling the behavior of the
              machine as a logic program.  General purpose program
              analysis and transformation of logic programs, such as
              partial evaluation and convex hull analysis, are applied
              to the logic based model of the machine.

              A small PIC microcontroller is used as a case study. An
              emulator for this microcontroller is written in Prolog,
              and standard programming transformations and analysis
              techniques are used to specialise this emulator with
              respect to a given PIC program. The specialised emulator
              can now be further analysed to gain insight into the
              given program for the PIC microcontroller.

              The method describes a general framework for applying
              abstractions, illustrated here by linear constraints and
              convex hull analysis, to logic programs. Using these
              techniques on the specialised PIC emulator, it is
              possible to obtain constraints on and linear relations
              between data registers, enabling detection of for
              instance overflows, branch conditions and so on."

              defining legitimate application behavior. In particular,
              additional information, such as the value of the program
              counter and the configuration of the program's call
              stack at each system call, has been used to achieve
              better characterization of program behavior. While there
              is common agreement that this additional information
              complicates the task for the attacker, it is less clear
              to which extent an intruder is constrained.
              In this paper, we present a novel technique to evade the
              extended detection features of state-of-the-art
              intrusion detection systems and reduce the task of the
              intruder to a traditional mimicry attack. Given a
              legitimate sequence of system calls, our technique
              allows the attacker to execute each system call in the
              correct execution context by obtaining and relinquishing
              the control of the application's execution flow through
              manipulation of code pointers.
              We have developed a static analysis tool for Intel x86
              binaries that uses symbolic execution to automatically
              identify instructions that can be used to redirect
              control flow and to compute the necessary modifications
              to the environment of the process. We used our tool to
              successfully exploit three vulnerable programs and evade
              detection by existing state-of-the-art system call
              monitors. In addition, we analyzed three real-world

              interpretation is the creation of abstractions that
              yield analyses that are both tractable and precise
              enough to prove interesting properties about real-world
              programs. One source of difficulty is the need to handle
              programs with different behaviors along different
              execution paths. Disjunctive (powerset) abstractions
              capture such distinctions in a natural way. However, in
              general, powerset abstractions increase the space and
              time by an exponential factor. Thus, powerset
              abstractions are generally perceived as being very
              costly. In this paper we partially address this
              challenge by presenting and empirically evaluating a new
              heap abstraction. The new heap abstraction works by
              merging shape descriptors according to a partial
              isomorphism similarity criteria, resulting in a
              partially disjunctive abstraction. We implemented this
              abstraction in TVLA --- a generic system for
              implementing program analyses. We conducted an empirical
              evaluation of the new abstraction and compared it with
              the powerset heap abstraction. The experiments show that
              analyses based on the partially disjunctive abstraction
              are as precise as the ones based on the fully
              disjunctive abstraction. In terms of performance,
              analyses based on the partially disjunctive abstraction
              are often superior to analyses based on the fully
              disjunctive heap abstraction. The empirical results show
              considerable speedups, up to 2 orders of magnitude,
              enabling previously non-terminating analyses, such as
              verification of the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite marking
              algorithm, to terminate with no negative effect on the
              overall precision. Indeed, experience indicates that the
              partially disjunctive shape abstraction improves
              performance across all TVLA analyses uniformly, and in
              many cases is essential for making precise shape
              analysis feasible."

  Abstract = "Convex polyhedra are often used to approximate sets of
              states of programs involving numerical variables. The
              manipulation of convex polyhedra relies on the so-called
              \emph{double description}, consisting of viewing a
              polyhedron both as the set of solutions of a system of
              linear inequalities, and as the convex hull of a
              \emph{system of generators}, i.e., a set of vertices and
              rays. The cost of these manipulations is highly
              dependent on the number of numerical variables, since
              the size of each representation can be exponential in
              the dimension of the space. In this paper, we
              investigate some ways for reducing the dimension: On one
              hand, when a polyhedron satisfies \emph{affine
              equations}, these equations can obviously be used to
              eliminate some variables. On the other hand, when groups
              of variables are unrelated with each other, this means
              that the polyhedron is in fact a \emph{Cartesian
              product} of polyhedra of lower dimensions. Detecting
              such Cartesian factoring is not very difficult, but we
              adapt also the operations to work on Cartesian
              products. Finally, we extend the applicability of
              Cartesian factoring by applying suitable \emph{variable

              tries to prove that a given class of queries terminates.

              GIMPLE and the natural loops, hosts the high level loop
              transformations. We base this presentation on the
              WRaP-IT project developed in the Alchemy group at INRIA
              Futurs and Paris-Sud University, on the PIPS compiler
              developed at École des mines de Paris, and on a joint
              work with several members of the static analysis and
              polyhedral compilation community in France.

              The main goal of this project is to bring more high
              level loop optimizations to GCC: loop fusion, tiling,
              strip mining, etc. Thanks to the WRaP-IT experience, we
              know that the polyhedral analyzes and transformations
              are affordable in a production compiler. A second goal

              operations on polyhedra with faster operations on more
              abstract domains. However, the use of a too coarse

              over approximated solution that cannot be used in

  Abstract = "Polyhedral analysis infers invariant linear equalities
              and inequalities of imperative programs. However, the
              exponential complexity of polyhedral operations such as
              image computation and convex hull limits the
              applicability of polyhedral analysis. Weakly relational
              domains such as intervals and octagons address the
              scalability issue by considering polyhedra whose
              constraints are drawn from a restricted, user-specified
              class. On the other hand, these domains rely solely on
              candidate expressions provided by the user. Therefore,
              they often fail to produce strong invariants.  We
              propose a polynomial time approach to strongly
              relational analysis. We provide efficient
              implementations of join and post condition operations,
              achieving a trade off between performance and
              accuracy. We have implemented a strongly relational
              polyhedral analyzer for a subset of the C
              language. Initial experimental results on benchmark
              examples are encouraging."

  Abstract = "We investigate techniques for automatically generating
              symbolic approximations to the time solution of a system
              of differential equations. This is an important
              primitive operation for the safety analysis of
              continuous and hybrid systems. In this paper we design a
              \emph{time elapse} operator that computes a symbolic
              over-approximation of time solutions to a continuous
              system starting from a given initial region. Our
              approach is iterative over the cone of functions (drawn
              from a suitable universe) that are non negative over the
              initial region. At each stage, we iteratively remove
              functions from the cone whose Lie derivatives do not lie
              inside the current iterate. If the iteration converges,
              the set of states defined by the final iterate is shown
              to contain all the time successors of the initial
              region. The convergence of the iteration can be forced
              using abstract interpretation operations such as
              widening and narrowing.  We instantiate our technique to
              linear hybrid systems with piecewise-affine dynamics to
              compute polyhedral approximations to the time
              successors. Using our prototype implementation TimePass,
              we demonstrate the performance of our technique on
              benchmark examples."

              modeled in the $\pi$-calculus by means of channel name
              passing. We chose SPIN because it supports channel name
              passing and can model reconfigurations. We extend the
              syntax of PROMELA and the verification algorithms based
