How To Get (More) PPL Documentation
===================================

Do you have all the documentation you need? If you don't or if you are
unsure, the following is for you.

There are two versions of the Parma Polyhedra Library's documentation:

  + a `user' manual, containing all and only the information needed by
    people willing to use the library;
  + a `devref' (developer reference) manual, also containing details
    about the library implementation.

Each of these versions can be obtained in several formats:

  + a PDF file suitable for browsing on the screen;
  + a PDF file suitable for printing;
  + a (gzipped) PostScript file suitable for printing;
  + a (tarred and gzipped) collection of HTML pages suitable for browsing.


The Documentation You May Already Have
======================================

First of all, you may already have some documentation and all you need
is to find it.

If you have downloaded a source (tar or zip) archive for PPL version
X.Y.Z, you will find in the doc subdirectory the following set of user
manuals:

  ppl-user-X.Y.Z-browse.pdf
  ppl-user-X.Y.Z-print.pdf
  ppl-user-X.Y.Z-print.ps.gz

If you have installed a binary RPM package, then you have the same set
of manuals. You can find them with the command `rpm -ql ppl' which
will print, among other things, something like

  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z
  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z/README
  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z/ppl-user-X.Y.Z-browse.pdf
  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z/ppl-user-X.Y.Z-print.pdf
  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z/ppl-user-X.Y.Z-print.ps.gz


The Documentation You May Download
==================================

If you are using the latest released version of the library, you will
find all the documentation in all formats at
http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/Documentation/ .


The Documentation You May Build Yourself
========================================

When all else fails (which is the case, for example, when you are
using a CVS version [1]) then you may build the documentation by
yourself. In order to do that, you should have a recent version of
Doxygen [2] and, if you want to build the HTML documentation, a recent
version of Graphviz [3].  When you have all the tools installed and
running, you should follow the following procedure.

First, you should determine which version of the library you are
working with. The safest way is to go to the top source directory of
the library and to locate the unique line in the file configure.ac
containing the string "AC_INIT". This will look like

  AC_INIT([the Parma Polyhedra Library], 0.6.3pre4, ppl-devel@cs.unipr.it, ppl)

from which you determine that the version is 0.6.3pre4 (a.k.a. the 4th
beta version before release 0.6.3).

Then, if you have not yet done it, build the library itself (see the
building instructions in the file INSTALL [4] in the top source
directory.  The default build process, while essential in order to
produce the documentation, will not generate it directly. For this
reason you should go to the doc subdirectory of your build directory
(i.e., the one where you compiled the library) and build all the
documents you want by executing a command of the form

    make doc1 doc2 ...

Here, doc1, doc2 and so forth are the names of the documents to build.
Document names can be obtained from the following list by replacing
X.Y.Z with the version number you have determined before, and by
replacing KIND with either `user' or `devref':

    ppl-KIND-X.Y.Z-browse.pdf
    ppl-KIND-X.Y.Z-print.pdf
    ppl-KIND-X.Y.Z-print.ps.gz
    ppl-KIND-X.Y.Z-html.tar.gz

For example, the command

    make ppl-user-0.6.3pre4-browse.pdf ppl-devref-0.6.3pre4-browse.pdf

will build both kinds of manuals in a PDF format that is suitable for
browsing. Alternatively, the command `make world' will build all the
available documentation in all of the above formats.
